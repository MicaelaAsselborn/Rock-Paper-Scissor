# Rock-Paper-Scissor

gameInit() it's executing only the last function. Need to fix that.
Solved by executing the corresponding case() function in each button, but I still want to find out why failed and how to solve it.
Also rock is selected almost double amount of times as scissors. Math problem, how to fix it?
